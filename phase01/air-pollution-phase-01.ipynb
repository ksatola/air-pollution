   "source": [
    "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), `air pollution` is the biggest environmental risk to health in the European Union (EU) causing each year about 400 000 premature deaths, and hundreds of billions of euro in health-related external costs [[1](#res)]. Air pollution occurs when gases, dust particles and smoke are released into the atmosphere, making it harmful to humans, infrastructure and the environment. Particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide and ground level ozone are the air pollutants responsible for most of these early deaths.\n",
    "\n",
    "We call `smog` any combination of air pollution, with or without humidity. The term smog (from smoke and fog) was created in early 1900s by the British researcher and doctor H.A. Des Voeux who conducted a research on after effects of air pollution problems in Glasgow and Edinburgh in autumn 1909, resulting in 1000 deaths [[9](#res)].\n",
    "\n",
    "The history of the problem of smelly smoke produced by forges, mines and other production facilities is very old. In 1273 the first known regulation was made in London regarding forbidden use of powdered coal. Since then there were many efforts put in place to control and improve air in big European and US cities. In 1775, Percival Pott, a well-known surgeon from London, described many cases of skin cancer of chimney sweeps and linked them to a contact with carbon black. In the industrial era, steam engines of steam locomotives, ships and factory machines became major pollution contributors. In 1888, a French professor Maximilien Ringelmann, invented the first way of pollution measurement, a few years later (1906) the first electrical precipitator was made. In the 20th century, new sources of pollution became apparent – cars and planes. The air pollution and associated with it `global warming` are considered one of the most serious civilizational and environmental challenges of the contemporary world [[9](#res)].\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two dimensions of air pollution and smog – global and local. Globally, it affects global warming. Locally, it influences quality of life and health of people living in different areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Poland, environmental awareness started growing slowly in the mid-1950s, but mainly in academia. While the western world put a lot of effort into diversification of energy sources with the main goal of reducing coal, in Poland coal still remains the mainstay of energy source [[2](#res)]. In the public debate, the main arguments against coal usage reduction are the need of mining industry preservation and destitute society not being able to afford modern, low emission solutions. While the world was improving, many Polish regions and cities started leading in pollution rankings. The quality of life – mainly during autumn and winter months – dropped drastically. Ultimately, in the 1990s consistent monitoring programs were put in place and various improvement programs were introduced (with the main contribution of UE regulations and funds) [[4](#res)]. Unfortunately, the change happens very slowly, mainly due to people's awareness of the problem growing slowly and the limited knowledge of how the improvement should be handled efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The WHO identifies `particulate matter (PM)`, `nitrogen dioxide (NO2)`, `sulphur dioxide (SO2)` and `ground-level ozone (O3)` as the main air pollutants that are most harmful to human health. The most dangerous of them are fine particles (PM2.5) which caused about 400 000 premature deaths of EU citizens in 2014 (and similarly in every consecutive year) [[1](#res)].\n",
    "Smog cannot be contained by authorities or environmental services alone. It can be only tamed by everyone, including ordinary people who need to understand how bad the smog is and act to replace cacoethes of burning garbage and (low-calorie) coal resulting in harmful substances in the air. It can be tamed by industry, another significant source of smog. In order to reduce it, we need to increase usage of ecological methods of heating but also in energy (power stations) and industrial production. Replacing old furnaces with modern ones with use of air cleaners could also help.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Air quality` does not only depend on pollution emissions. It also depends on proximity to the source and altitude at which pollutants are released; meteorological conditions, including wind and heat; chemical transformations (reactions to sunlight, pollutant interactions); geographical conditions (topography). Air pollution emissions result mostly from human action (as stated before) but they can also result from forest fires, volcanic eruptions and wind erosion. Air pollution is natural but its extend in the modern world is not [[9](#res)].\n",
    "\n",
    "Smog can be very sneaky. It may have greater impact on children who, when become adult, may suffer from diseases related to chemical compounds cumulated in their bodies. That is another reason why it is so important to eliminate smog (long-term) and avoid open air activities (short-term) when smog concentration outside is too high.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not only important to reduce air pollution but also to understand current air conditions around us to passively reduce its impact on our health by limiting our exposure. This is the main reason for the research described in this study – based on existing air pollution sensors' measurements (collected in the Kraków area, a high pollution hotspot). Kraków - my home city - struggles with very poor air quality, particularly during the winter season. Concentrations of particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) and benzo(a)pyrene are exceedingly high throughout the whole region.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to find best analytical methods for predicting fine particles of particulate matter (PM2.5) level. This could help ordinary people in planning any activities in the open air and reduce impact the air pollution makes to their health."

    "There are a few technical options for a data science project setup: Python, R, cloud analytical services (AWS SageMaker, Azure ML) or locally installed software like IBM SPSS or KNIME, to name a few. The approach and toolkit should be chosen based not only on the data scientist's personal preference and professional skills but mainly based on how it would fit the business problem solution’s requirements, cost and timing. How the data product is meant to be used and maintained after it is created and by whom. What the other factors are which could impact technical decisions. Last but not least, it is a good practice to strive for consistency which makes the learning curve for all project team members shallower, this is valid not only for a single project but also for a portfolio of all projects being executed in a company, institution or any other kind of organization, or by any group.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python\n",
    "This project’s technical components are based mainly on Python-related tools and modules. Mainly, because most of the analytical components needed are natively available in Python, but also because the final data product is a web app which should be easily customizable. Building all the pieces in Python, allows full flexibility and increases the speed of combining different components. It also makes it easier and faster to join ready-to-use components with custom code. Python virtual environment is used to separate the dependencies required by this project from all other ones and a global Python configuration on development machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Source Code Repository\n",
    "To manage and share the project's code, Git and its free web version ([github](https://github.com/)) is used. Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "As a lab environment for experimentation and prototyping, Jupyter Notebook is used (or its more IDE-like version – Jupyter Lab). The Jupyter Lab is a web-based interactive development environment for Jupyter notebooks, code, and data. The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integrated Development Environment\n",
    "As for quick experimentation and work documentation Jupyter is the right choice, nut for Python code long-term structuring and development, \"The Python IDE for Professional Developers\" – PyCharm is the tool of my choice (but other tools can be also as good as PyCharm is, or better). It is full-fledged integrated programming environment (IDE) with many configuration and extension options. It is a good choice for Python programming as it can be used for free (Community Edition) and supports good programming practices.\n",

    "1. Divide the test data into folds. Folds start at each data point of the test set (daily for the daily data and hourly for the hourly data) and contain as many values as required for long-term prediction (7 for the daily data and 24 for the hourly data).\n",

    "    1. Forecast values one by one, starting from lag+1 to lag+7 or lag+24, replacing the historical data (shifted one by one into the future) with just made predictions. The further in the future, the bigger error is expected to be generated by this forecasting method.\n",
    "    1. Gather results (figure 7.1), calculate RMSE of the fold's forecasts and observed values (from the test dataset).\n",

    "- The time series data is stationary.\n",

    "**The first assumption is:** The previous time step(s) – lag(s) – is useful in predicting the value at the next time step (dependence between values). If the time series data values are independent of each other, autoregressive model isn’t going to be a good forecasting method for that series (no correlation). This assumption can be checked by looking at the plot of entire time series (figure 7.3) and calculating autocorrelation between the time series and its lags (figure 7.4).\n",

For the dataset for statistical methods modelling 3 more lags are considered for the modelling (t-2, t-3 and t-4). All of them are statistically significant, too. After lag 4, we observe steady decline of correlation coefficient value.\n",

    "**The second assumption is:** The time series data is `stationary`. The time series is stationary if its mean (and/or variance) is constant over time (over a specified time range). If the time series data isn’t stationary, it should be made that way with some form of trend and seasonality removal (decomposition) or an application of so-called power transform. In order to check for stationarity, 2 tests were performed on PM2.5 data:\n",

    "The goal of this dissertation was to describe efforts and scientific method for comparison effectiveness of different analytical techniques which could be used to predict fine particles of particulate matter (PM2.5) levels (time series univariate forecasting problem). \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to achieve the goal, air-pollution and climate data were scrapped from IMGW and GIOS web sites to create an analytical view (with only PM2.5 timeseries being in scope). Based on the view, an exploratory data analysis was performed, and then additional data transformation for modelling were made, with different resampling and feature engineering techniques. Different statistical methods were used to assess time series readiness for modelling (correlation and stationarity tests).\n",
    "\n",
    "Three types of analytical techniques (basic, statistical and machine learning models) were used to create a ranking of best performing algorithms for PM2.5 forecasting. The method of comparison was mean RMSE and a custom validation function for fairness of results was created using walk-forward validation approach. Using the common validation approach the winner technique (Random Forrest regressor) and the best group (machine learning) were identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end, a proposal for further work was made with the main aim of improving forecasting and computational performance."
