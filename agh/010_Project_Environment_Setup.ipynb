    "There are a few technical options (environments) for data science project: Python, R, cloud analytical services (AWS SageMaker, Azure ML) or locally installed software like IBM SPSS or KNIME, to name a few. The approach and toolkit should be chosen based not only on the data scientist's personal preference and professional skills but mainly based on how it would fit the business problem solution' s requirements, cost and timing. How the data product is meant to be used and maintaned after it is created, by whom and how frequent are other factors which should impact technical decisions. Last but not least, it is a good practice to strive for consistency which makes the learning curve for all team members shallower, this is valid not only for a single project but also for a portfolio of all projects being executed in a company, institution or any other kind of organization."

    "This project's technical components will be based mainly on Python-related tools and modules. Mainly because most of the components needed are natively available in Python, but also because the final data product is a web app which we want to be able to customize. Building all the pieces in Python, allows full flexibility and increases the speed of combining different components. It also makes it easier to combine ready-to-use components with custom code getting us to the specified point faster. \n",

    "\n",
    "**Virtualenv** is a tool that lets you create an isolated Python environment for your project. It creates an environment that has its own installation directories, that doesn’t share dependencies with other virtualenv environments. You can also configure what version of Python you want to use for each individual environment. It's very much recommended to use virtualenv when dealing with Python applications.\n",
